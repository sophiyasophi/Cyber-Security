Cyber security: Securing data,devices etc.,
Networks: Medium to communicate
Hacking: Gaining unaunthorized access
Ethical hacking: Gaining unaunthorized access with written concern
Vulnerability: Weakness in an information system that could be exploited by a threat source
Cyber security tools:
    Hashcat: Password hacking tool
    Bruteforce technique
    Attacks
    RAT(Remote Access Trojan)
    Metasploit
Implementing security:
     Physical control  
     Administrative control  
     Logical control
Port scanning
Protocol: Set of rules
TCP/UDP: 
    To connect the hardware and software
    Connects Top layer to Bottom layer
    TCP contains 65,535 ports
    UDP contains 65,535 ports
    Totally 1,30,070 ports
    The ports are entry gates of a system
    443-https(safe) and 80-http(unsafe)
Differnce between HTTPS and HTTP
Block chain
Exploit: 
      A particular attack
      Exploits system vulnerabilities
SQL injection
Session hijacking
Phishing
DNS
IP address
Cloud
Cryptography
Spoofing
Hashing
Specific hacking
Web application penetration testing
    Web page:
    Web application: User interaction

Career opportunities: 
    Offensive- red team
    Defensive (SOC analyst)- blue team
    Both-purple team
Types of hackers:
    White hat- Software architecture is completely known(architecture-blueprint of entire software application)
    Black hat- Hackers(without any information or knowledge)
    Grey hat- Both white and black hat(dangerous)
    Script kiddies- Using tools without knowledge
    Hacktivism- Hacking for social causes
    Blue hat- 
    Red hat-
    State sponsored hackers(govt)- Government pays and make them to hack other state information
CIA(Network Security):
    Confidentiality
    Integrity
    Availability
Confidentiality:
Authentication: Verifying one's identity
To verify one's authentication:
    Knowledge(Something known) Eg:DOB,Secret questions etc.,
    Physical(Something you have) Eg:Aadhar,Passport,Phone number etc.,
    Biometrics(behavioural patterns) Eg:Fingerprints,Physical appearances etc.,
Authorisation(Access control): Permission to access
UAC: User Access Control
Integrity: Originality
    Safe data transfer-https
    SSL: Secured Software Layer
    Encryption: Conversion of clear texts to cipher texts
Availability: 
    Eg: ATM availability(demonitization)
    Firewall
    Antivirus
Breach: Loss of control,a person other than an authorised user accesses identifiable information   
Event: Observable occurance in a network or system
Incident: Actually or potentially jeopardizes(affects) the CIA of an information system
Intrusion: 
    A security event
Threat: 
    Event with potential to adversely impact organisational operations
    High occurance of threat is classfied as high risk
    Vulnerability + Threat = Risk
Zero day: A previously unknown system vulnerability with potential of exploitation without risk of detection
